# sqlite-net-sqlcipher-sample

This is a sample using the sqlite-net-sqlcipher NuGet Package for .NET MAUI. 

I only tested it in iOS and Mac apps probably using SQLitePCL.Batteries_V2.Init(); in the MainActivity solve an issue in Android. 

The sample is based in the Microsoft Learn SQLite exercise
